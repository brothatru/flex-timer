## Project Retro

Overall had fun with this project. Would've liked to have spent some more time on it, but didn't want to keep you guys waiting!

I ended up using the traditional setInterval() (yea i know, i'm lame) since it was the easiest to set up, but I would've liked to have experimented with **requestAnimationFrame** because I saw a few examples that argued for its efficiency.

## Author Bio

I am a developer that has worked for many start ups of all sizes across several different industries including digital ads, media, real estate, and market research.

For the last 8 years or so, I've grown with the ever-changing and constantly evolving web, from using traditional fullstack php creating websites using wordpress and jquery to more modern single page applications such as NodeJS and React, utilzing service oriented apis and optimzations such as code splitting and server-side rendering.

I love working with the latest front end technologies and participating in developer sessions, where members take turns mentoring the rest of the team on confusing or trending topics.

For the last year I've also been focused on personal growth, improving my habits and making a conscious effort to improve myself by 1% better each day.

One of my biggest goals over the next few years is to transition into a full blown digital nomad (damn you covid for delaying my dreams!), as I continue to learn and grow with those around me.
